# Vanilla Js Calculator
## Inspired by IOS calculator

This was my first real toy project. I made it mainly to see how to connect HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to build a
real application. I learned how to layout an application using flexBox (i'm yet to update this calculator to CSS grid,
which would make more sense) and to style the app acording to a given design (in this case, Apple's Iphone calculator). 


Furthermore, it was great to use Vanilla Javascript to build this, so i got in touch with the language itself before jumping
to frameworks, like react. The only major flaw with this app is the use of 'calc' to evaluate the math in the display, but i
thought to leave it be as this was just a toy ptoject and nothing very serious.
